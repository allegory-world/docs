## Overview

The Allegory MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server enables Claude Desktop to directly access and search Allegory's nonprofit funder database. This allows Claude to answer questions about funders, grant history, and funding patterns without requiring manual API calls.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol developed by Anthropic that enables AI assistants to connect to external data sources and tools. By installing the Allegory MCP Server, you give Claude the ability to:

- Search for nonprofit funders by name, location, or focus area
- Retrieve detailed funder information
- Query grant history and funding patterns
- Analyze giving trends across multiple funders

## Installation

<Note>
  Full installation instructions coming soon. The Allegory MCP Server is currently in development.
</Note>

### Prerequisites

- Claude Desktop application
- Node.js 18 or higher
- An Allegory API key (required - contact us at hello@allegory.world)

### Quick Start

```bash
# Installation instructions will be added here
npm install -g @allegory/mcp-server
```

## Configuration

<Note>
The MCP server requires an Allegory API key to access the funder database. You'll configure this in your Claude Desktop settings.
