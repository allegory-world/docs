You only need to include the fields you want to update. All other fields will remain unchanged.

{
  "status": "submitted"
}
```

## Common status values

While you can use any string for status, common values include:

- `new` - Newly discovered opportunity
- `reviewing` - Under review by your team
- `in_progress` - Actively working on application
- `submitted` - Application submitted
- `awarded` - Grant awarded
- `rejected` - Application rejected
- `closed` - Opportunity closed

<Tip>
The `updated_at` timestamp is automatically set to the current time when you update an opportunity.

<Warning>
You can only update opportunities that belong to your organization. The `organization_id` cannot be changed.
