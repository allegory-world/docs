Retrieve the grant-making history for a specific funder from IRS 990 filings. This endpoint provides access to historical grant data showing who the funder has supported and how much they've given.

## Data source

Grant history data is extracted from IRS Form 990 filings, which nonprofits are required to file annually. The data includes:
- Grant recipients and their EINs
- Grant amounts (cash and non-cash)
- Grant purposes and descriptions
- Transaction years

<Info>
**Data Freshness:** Grant history is synced daily from our analytics warehouse at 4am UTC. New 990 filings are typically available within 24-48 hours of being filed with the IRS.

## Pagination

This endpoint supports pagination with a maximum of 1000 records per page:

- **Default limit**: 100 grants per page
- **Maximum limit**: 1000 grants per page
- Use `offset` to navigate through pages (e.g., page 2: `offset=100`)

<Tip>
For funders with extensive grant history, use the `limit` parameter to fetch larger pages (up to 1000) to reduce the number of API calls needed.
